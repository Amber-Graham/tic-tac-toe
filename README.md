# tic-tac-toe
Play tic-tac-toe using only Ruby!

<h2>Reflection</h2>
This was such a huge learning process for me.
I ended up with three versions, with each version getting more sorted.
It took me some time to realize how everything linked up and I had to look 
at several different resources to help me see the overall picture.

I definitely look forward to getting more practice using OOP. All in time!
